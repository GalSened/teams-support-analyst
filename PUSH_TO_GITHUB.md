## 🔧 Steps to Push (Windows)

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

**Option A: Via Web Browser (Easier)**
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `teams-support-analyst`
3. Description: `AI-powered Teams support analyst using Claude Code with @mention detection, stability loop, intelligent repo selection, and local code search`
4. **Public** (or Private - your choice)
5. **DO NOT** check "Initialize with README" (we already have code)
6. Click **Create repository**

**Option B: Via GitHub CLI (if installed)**
```powershell
gh repo create teams-support-analyst --public --description "AI-powered Teams support analyst with intelligent repo selection"
```

---

### Step 2: Add Remote and Push

Open PowerShell in the project directory:

```powershell
cd C:/Users/gals/teams-support-analyst

# Add GitHub remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/teams-support-analyst.git

# Rename branch to main (GitHub default)
git branch -M main

# Push all commits
git push -u origin main
```

**If you get authentication error:**
- GitHub now requires Personal Access Token (PAT) instead of password
- Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens
- Generate new token (classic) with `repo` scope
- Use token as password when prompted

---

### Step 3: Verify

After pushing, verify at:
```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/teams-support-analyst
