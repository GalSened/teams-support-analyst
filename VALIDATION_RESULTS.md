### 4. Security Hardening

**Status**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**

| Control | Status | Location |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Input Validation | ✅ | search.ts:46-51 |

| Binary File Detection | ✅ | file.ts:22-38 |
| Secret Management | ✅ | .env (gitignored) |
| Error Handling | ✅ | No sensitive data in errors |
| Query Sanitization | ✅ | Removes shell metacharacters |

**Documented Recommendations** (not implemented, optional):
- API key authentication (low priority - localhost only)
- Rate limiting (20 req/min suggested)
- HTTPS/TLS (optional for localhost)
- Audit logging (basic logging sufficient)

See [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) for complete security documentation.

## 🐛 Known Issues

### Issue #1: Windows "nul" Reserved Filename
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED
**Impact**: Was causing ripgrep failures in user-backend
**Fix**: File removed, added to .gitignore
**Location**: user-backend repository

### Issue #2: Test Suite JSON Escaping
**Status**: ⚠️ DOCUMENTED
**Impact**: 2 file operation tests fail due to curl/PowerShell path escaping
**Workaround**: Use Invoke-RestMethod instead of curl for file operations
**Note**: API itself works correctly; this is a testing methodology issue

### Issue #3: Teams Authentication Expiration
**Status**: ✅ EXPECTED BEHAVIOR
**Impact**: Orchestrator returns 401 Unauthorized after token expires
**Resolution**: Run `npx @floriscornel/teams-mcp@latest authenticate` to renew
**Frequency**: Varies based on OAuth token lifetime (typically 1-24 hours)

3. Test with actual @mention in Teams
4. Review and adjust performance settings if needed (MAX_ATTEMPTS, CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD)
5. Set up scheduled task for health checks (optional)
6. Configure log rotation (optional)

**Recommended Next Steps**:
1. Test with live Teams message to verify end-to-end flow
2. Deploy as Windows service (see PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT.md)
3. Set up monitoring alerts (optional)
4. Schedule regular security reviews (monthly)
